Given the chat so far, extract the final user profile as JSON ONLY.
- If any field is missing, invalid, or not explicitly confirmed by the user, reply with: {"status":"incomplete"}

Schema:
{ "firstName":"", "lastName":"", "idNumber":"", "gender":"", "age":0, "hmo":"", "hmoCard":"", "tier":"" }

Return ONLY JSON. No explanations.
